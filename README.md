Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2017, 12(4): 73-87".)

2. The attention-based multi performance indicators optimization algorithm for large scale systems is from "https://github.com/MaxHHK/LMOAM". (Reference: Hong, Haokai, et al. "Balancing exploration and exploitation for solving large-scale multiobjective optimization via attention mechanism." 2022 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC). IEEE, 2022.)

3. To optimize your own customized optimization problem, please first create your own objective functions and constraint functions. Then, you can call these defined functions in PlatEMO interference to finish problem parameter settings. Next, you can choose corresponding algorithms to solve the target optimization problem with selected algorithms.
